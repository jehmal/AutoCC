## 🛠️ Workflow Scripts Reference

All scripts are in `.claude/workflows/`:

- **`daily-setup.sh`** - Start development environment
- **`feature-development.sh <name>`** - Complete feature workflow
- **`bug-fix.sh "description"`** - Systematic bug resolution
- **`quality-check.sh`** - Comprehensive quality validation
- **`deployment-prep.sh`** - Pre-deployment verification

Plus tech-specific generators:
- **`component-generator.sh`** (Frontend projects)
- **`api-generator.sh`** (Backend projects)  
- **`screen-generator.sh`** (Mobile projects)

## 📚 Documentation Generated

- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Complete project development guide
- **`.claude-setup-report.md`** - Setup summary and quick commands
- **`.claude/`** - Configuration and workflow directory
- **`.github/workflows/`** - CI/CD automation (if git repository)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
